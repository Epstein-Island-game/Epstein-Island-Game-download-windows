## 🧠 Overview  

**Epstein Island: The Game** is an atmospheric interactive project built around exploration, symbolism, and environmental storytelling. Rather than relying on traditional objectives, the experience encourages players to observe, listen, and interpret the world through its visuals and sound design.

The island setting serves as a surreal space filled with abstract locations and subtle narrative hints. Progression is driven by curiosity, allowing players to uncover fragments of meaning by moving through environments at their own pace. The absence of explicit guidance places emphasis on personal interpretation and immersion.

Gameplay mechanics are intentionally minimal, keeping focus on mood and atmosphere. Lighting, architecture, and audio cues work together to create a sense of unease and reflection, shaping an experience that feels more like an interactive art piece than a conventional game.

Designed for players who appreciate unconventional storytelling, **Epstein Island: The Game** offers a contemplative journey that invites thought and discussion long after the session ends.
